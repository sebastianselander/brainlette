Project Overview
================

The project has three parts: a frontend for the Javalette language
(Part A), a backend with code generation for LLVM (Part B), and
extensions to the compiler (Part C).

The project is to be done individually or in groups of two. A group's
final grade is based on the number of extensions completed for Part C
of the course, based on [a system of credits per implemented
extension](extensions.md).

Collaboration and academic honesty
----------------------------------

We take academic honesty seriously. As mentioned above, students work
individually or in groups of two on this project. Each
individual/group must develop their own code, and are _not allowed to
share code with other students or to get, or even look at, code
developed by others_. Having said that, we do encourage discussions
among participants in the course about the project at a conceptual
level. Students who get significant help from others must make a note
of this and acknowledge (in their documentation file) those who helped.

Don't be a cheater.
